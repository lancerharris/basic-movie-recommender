Basic Python Terminal Movie Recommender

Here I've created a simplistic terminal recommender program. This program uses a hardcoded dataset of a few A24 movies for the user to choose from. 

The user is asked for a category of movie they'd like to find. The two levels of categories are genre and the mood of the film. Once the user picks from these predefined genres and moods, a list of movies will be presented for them.

I used this program as an opportunity to practice a tree data structure with some Node based functionality for the tree. The recommender functions operate on the Nodes.

The program could be expanded to pull from an API to get more accurate and up to data movie information.
